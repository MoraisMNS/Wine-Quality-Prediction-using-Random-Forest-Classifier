# Wine-Quality-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-Classifier
This is a predictive model using Random Forest Classifier. This algorithm  delves into the intricate interplay of wine characteristics such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity,density,pH,sulphates,alchohols and citric acid etc.  Sourced from Kaggle, the dataset forms the cornerstone of this project.

## Key Features
- Utilizes Random Forest Classifier algorithm
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle
- Features include fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, and more
